# AGENTS.md

Operational brief for coding agents and humans alike. Rules here, reasons in
[`docs/development/`](docs/development/architecture.md).

## What this is

An MCP server (FastMCP 3, Python 3.12) that turns Markdown or structured
input into Office files. Runs in Docker on port 8958, endpoint `/mcp`,
streamable-HTTP. Entry point `main.py`. Six static tools (Word, Excel,
PowerPoint, template listing, email, XML) plus dynamic tools registered from
YAML templates.

## Commands

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
ruff check .                     # lint (CI)
pytest -m "not network"          # tests (CI); plain `pytest` includes network tests
pytest tests/test_docx_base.py   # one module
python main.py                   # run locally, no .env needed
```

## Layout

```
main.py             tool handlers, startup order, health routes, server launch
config.py           the only module that reads os.environ; get_config() singleton
async_runner.py     run_blocking(): bounded thread pool for every blocking call
librechat_integration.py   request-header user context; upload_and_format_response()
upload_tools/       upload_file() / upload_file_async() dispatch; backends/<strategy>.py
template_utils.py   template file resolution (custom → default, container → local)
template_registry.py  YAML merging (master + *.d/) for specs and for the
                    kind-wide _global.yaml; live tool removal
inline_markdown.py  the inline-emphasis grammar shared by Word and PowerPoint
warning_channel.py  DocumentWarning + WarningChannel: what a build worked around
image_utils.py      image download/decode with the SSRF guard
metrics.py          in-process counters for the admin Status page
docx_tools/ xlsx_tools/ pptx_tools/ email_tools/ xml_tools/   one package per type
admin/              optional FastHTML admin UI (ADMIN_ENABLED); app.py holds
                    routes only — components.py (markup + theme),
                    sections.py (the product areas and their tabs), kinds.py
                    (dynamic kinds), base_templates.py (static base
                    templates), forms.py, views/ (views/sections.py = the
                    tabbed shell, Overview and the dashboard;
                    views/settings.py = the Word style mapping)
docs/               user reference (docs/*.md) and development docs (docs/development/)
```

Request path: handler in `main.py` → `await run_blocking(_<type>_buffer, …)`
→ `extract_user_context_from_request()` → `upload_and_format_response()` →
backend → URL string or LibreChat artifact dict. Details:
[architecture.md](docs/development/architecture.md).

## Rules

**Structure**
- Every tool package exposes a private `_…_buffer()` that returns `BytesIO`
  — or `(BytesIO, warnings)` where the tool has a warnings channel (Word,
  Excel, PowerPoint) — and a public wrapper that also uploads. `main.py` calls
  the buffer function only. New tool: follow
  [adding-a-tool.md](docs/development/adding-a-tool.md).
- Blocking work goes through `await run_blocking(...)`, always. Never call
  a buffer function or `upload_file()` directly from an `async def` handler.
- Read request headers on the event loop, before dispatch; never inside a
  buffer function.
- Dynamic template tools follow the same split as the static ones: the
  offloaded body **builds only** and returns `(BytesIO, filename,
  add_unique_prefix)`, and the tool's `async def` reads the user context, then
  uploads through `upload_and_format_response()` on the event loop and closes
  the buffer in a `finally`. Never upload from inside the offloaded body: the
  LIBRECHAT strategy needs an awaitable upload, and the request headers are
  unreadable on a worker thread.
- Config: read via `get_config()`; never `os.environ` outside `config.py`.
  A new variable goes into `config.py`, `.env.example` and
  `docs/configuration.md`; `tests/test_config_docs.py` enforces it.
- Templates: resolve through `template_utils`; never hard-code a path.
- Images: `image_utils.load_image()`; never `requests` directly.
- Links: a renderer makes a hyperlink only when
  `inline_markdown.is_safe_link_target()` allows it, and the build reports a
  refusal from `refused_link_targets()`.
- Logging: `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Level comes from `DEBUG` only.

**Errors**
- Raise `fastmcp.exceptions.ToolError` only at the handler boundary in
  `main.py` or a dynamic tool body. `RuntimeError` in the upload layer.
  `ValueError` for input the caller can fix.
- A backend returns a string on success, `None` or raises on failure. Never
  return an error message as a string.

**Warnings**
- A branch that skips, substitutes or degrades something the caller asked for
  reports it: `warnings.add(code, message, **location)` beside the `logger`
  call, never the log alone. The caller gets a success response and never
  reads the server log.
- The channel is a `WarningChannel` from `warning_channel.py`, created in the
  `_…_buffer()` function and threaded down as an **argument**. Never module
  state: builds run concurrently on worker threads.
- Every code lives in the package's `warnings.py` with a severity in its
  `WARNING_SEVERITY` (`error` = not in the file, `warning` = there but not as
  asked, `info` = a substitution the caller will not mind). Each package's
  `test_every_code_has_a_severity` enforces it.
- A tool with a channel returns `(BytesIO, warnings)` from its buffer
  function; `main.py` attaches them with `_with_warnings()`, passing the
  tool's `kind` and `name` — that call also records them for the admin Status
  page, and the arguments are required so a new tool cannot go uncounted.
  PowerPoint keeps its own `SlideWarning` record and shares the severities.

**Word**
- One line-break model: every newline reaching the inline layer is a soft
  break; two-space runs are assembled by `_soft_break_run()` in the block
  dispatcher and stop before any block. Never give `expand_br_to_block_breaks()`
  the renderer's numbering state (#110). Details in
  [word.md](docs/development/tools/word.md#one-line-break-model).

**PowerPoint**
- Never index `slide_layouts[N]` in a builder; go through `_new_slide()`.
- Never measure text against a hardcoded point size: read what the template
  really renders at with `read_body_font_size()`. The fit estimate is wrong by
  the square of any error, and the overflow warning comes from the same number.
- Never match a content placeholder by `idx`: a customer template numbers them
  however it likes. Columns come from `content_columns()`, a single body from
  `_content_placeholders()`. Only footers and slide numbers still read `idx`
  (11 and 12). Details in
  [powerpoint.md](docs/development/tools/powerpoint.md#two-columns-matched-by-geometry).
- Keep the published slide schema flat (no `oneOf`/`$ref`/`discriminator`);
  validation is `coerce_slides()` in the build step.
- Write a caller's text with `inline_formatting.write_text()`, never
  `paragraph.text` — the tool promises inline markdown and links in every
  text field, and a direct assignment prints the markers instead.
- Every warning takes a code from `pptx_tools/warnings.py`, and every code
  takes a severity in `WARNING_SEVERITY`.

**Admin UI**
- Build pages from `admin/components.py`, never hand-written FastHTML trees.
  A labelled control goes through `field()` — it is what mints the `id` and
  points the `<label>` at it; a table goes through `data_table()`, which is
  what keeps a wide table from scrolling the whole page.
- Per-kind wording and flags live in `admin/kinds.py`, storage metadata in
  `admin/store.py`. Add a kind by editing those two tables, not by adding a
  branch to a view.
- The top-level navigation lives in `admin/sections.py`: one `Section` per
  product area (Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Email, XML, Server) and its tabs.
  The nav, the tab bars, the routes and the dashboard are all derived from
  that table — add a section by adding a row, never by adding a route.
- A tab renderer is a **panel**: a list of cards with no shell, wrapped by
  `views.sections.section_page()`. `app.py`'s `_panel()` is the one
  (section, tab) → renderer map, and every route that re-renders a tab after
  a POST goes back through it. A page reached *from* a tab (an editor, a
  confirmation) is a full page and names its section with
  `views.shell.kind_page()`, so the nav keeps the right item lit.
- Section routes are registered **before** the `/{kind}/…` ones and are
  **GET-only**; every two-segment `/{kind}/…` route is a POST. That is what
  lets the Email section live at `/email` beside the `email` kind. Slugs are
  literal, never a `/{slug}` pattern — a catch-all would swallow `/new/docx`.
  `sections.assert_slugs_free()` fails at startup on a slug that shadows a
  page, and `tests/test_admin_sections.py` walks the route table for the
  actual invariant.
- `admin/kinds.py`'s `STYLE_KEYS` must match the keys `docx_tools/style_map.py`
  recognises; `tests/test_admin_style_keys.py` enforces it. Style-name labels
  come from `DEFAULT_STYLE_MAP`, never a second copy.
- No external assets, ever: no CDN stylesheet, no `<script src>`, no web font.
  The theme and scripts are inlined by `components.head_tags()` and
  `tests/test_admin_assets.py` enforces it on every rendered page.
- Colours are CSS custom properties on `:root`, redefined under
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. A new rule takes a token, never a literal, or
  it will be wrong in one of the two themes. Spacing, type sizes, radii and
  shadows are tokens too (`--sp-*`, `--fs-*`, `--r-*`); use the nearest one
  rather than a value between two.
- Navigation is links, not script: `tab_bar()` renders anchors to real URLs so
  a tab is bookmarkable and works with JavaScript off. The only script on any
  page is the argument-row cloner.
- A card's own buttons go in `card(..., actions=[...])`, a page's primary
  action in `page_header()`. Never append them to a card's body, where they
  read as part of the content above them.

**Dynamic tools and schemas**
- Never `Optional[...]` on a dynamic-tool argument; optionality is the
  default alone. Descriptions must be siblings of a flat type.
- Do not give `add_unique_prefix` a default in a dynamic tool body; it must
  reach `upload_file()` as `None`.
- A disabled template (`enabled: false`) is filtered in
  `template_registry.gather_specs()` — the one merge point every registration
  path uses — never at a call site. A new consumer of `gather_specs()` gets
  the filtering for free; only the admin UI passes `include_disabled=True`.
  Absent means enabled, so specs written before #165 stay live.
- Kind-wide settings (a master file's *top-level* keys, e.g. Word's
  `style_mapping`) merge in `template_registry.global_config()` — the one
  merge point, as `gather_specs()` is for templates. A `*.d/_global.yaml` key
  **replaces** the master's key, never merges into it, and `templates:` is
  never taken from it. The filename is reserved: `read_spec_dir()` skips it
  and `store.validate_name()` refuses the name `_global` (#161).
- The global style map is cached against its config files' mtime and size,
  never for the process lifetime: a UI edit must apply without a restart.
  Anything that *writes* it calls `invalidate_global_style_map()` — the
  fingerprint cannot see two writes in one timestamp tick — and must also
  re-register the Word tools, which bake the map in at registration.
  `AdminContext.resync_docx_style_map()` does both.

**Docs — part of every change, never a follow-up**
- Before you finish any change, find every page under `docs/` that describes
  what you touched and update it in the same commit. Concretely:
  - **Internal change** (new, renamed, moved or removed module or function; a
    pipeline step added or reordered; a new invariant, gotcha or extension
    point): the package's page under `docs/development/tools/` or the
    relevant `docs/development/*.md` — its pipeline diagram, module map,
    "how it works", extension points and invariants. Change this file too if
    a rule here changes.
  - **User-visible change** (input format, parameter, output shape,
    behaviour): the tool description in `main.py`, the reference page under
    `docs/`, and the tests, together.
  - **New environment variable**: `config.py`, `.env.example`,
    `docs/configuration.md`; `tests/test_config_docs.py` enforces this.
  - **A limitation you fixed**: remove it from the page's "Known limitations"
    and close or update the issue it links to.
  - **A new package or backend**: a new page in the same shape as the others,
    linked from `docs/README.md`.
- A change with no doc update is only correct if you checked and nothing
  described what you touched. Say so in the commit message.
- Each package's module docstring names what it owns and which entry point
  `main.py` uses. Keep it true.

## Tests

- One file per behaviour under `tests/`. Regression tests name the issue.
- Build without uploading: patch `upload_file` where it is looked up
  (`<pkg>.base_<type>_tool.upload_file`), or call the buffer function.
  PowerPoint tests instantiate `PowerpointPresentation` and call `.save()`.
- Output for manual inspection goes to `tests/output/{docx,pptx,xlsx}/`.
- Config is a singleton read at import; see
  [testing.md](docs/development/testing.md) for the reload pattern.
