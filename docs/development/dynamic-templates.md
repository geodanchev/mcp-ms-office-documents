# Dynamic template tools

Word and email templates declared in YAML, or saved through the admin UI,
become MCP tools of their own at startup and can be added, replaced or
removed while the server runs. This page explains the mechanism. For **what**
a template file may contain, see [`../templates.md`](../templates.md) and the
commented master files under `config/`.

PowerPoint templates are a different thing: a design, not a fill-in
document. They do not become tools; they become values for the `template`
argument of the presentation tool. See
[`tools/powerpoint.md`](tools/powerpoint.md).

## Where specs come from

| Source | Path | Written by |
|--------|------|------------|
| Master file | `config/docx_templates.yaml`, `config/email_templates.yaml` | a person; heavily commented; never rewritten by tooling |
| Per-template files | `config/docx_templates.d/<name>.yaml`, `config/email_templates.d/<name>.yaml` | the admin UI (`admin/store.py`) |
| Kind-wide settings | `config/<kind>_templates.d/_global.yaml` | the admin UI (`admin/store.py`) |

`template_registry.gather_specs()` merges the two: master entries in their
original order, a `.d` entry replacing a master entry with the same `name`,
and `.d`-only entries appended in name order. It also returns the kind's
top-level config so callers can read `style_mapping` — see
[Kind-wide settings](#kind-wide-settings). A malformed `.d` file is logged and
skipped; it never aborts the load. The same loader serves the PowerPoint
registry.

### Kind-wide settings

`<kind>_templates.d/_global.yaml` is the merge layer's home for what the
master file keeps at *top level* rather than under `templates:` — for Word,
`style_mapping`. It exists so the admin UI can edit those settings without
rewriting the master file, which is hand-written documentation the tooling
never touches ([#161](https://github.com/ForLegalAI/mcp-ms-office-documents/issues/161)).

`template_registry.global_config(master_yaml, spec_dir)` is the one merge
point, as `gather_specs()` is for templates. Three rules:

- **A key here replaces the master's key outright; it does not merge into
  it.** A key-wise merge would make a setting the admin cleared fall back to
  the master's value, so the UI would show "(use built-in)" while the master's
  name went on being applied — the lie #161 is about.
- **Presence is what counts.** An explicit `style_mapping: {}` means *nothing
  overridden*; deleting the file hands the kind back to the master. The two
  are different states and the UI offers both (Save with every field cleared,
  and Revert).
- **`templates:` is never taken from it.** That list is `gather_specs()`'s
  business; one file able to register tools by a back door is not a power this
  layer should have.

The filename is reserved: `read_spec_dir()` skips it so it is never read as a
template, and `admin.store.validate_name()` refuses the name `_global` so a
template cannot be written over it.

**`enabled: false` is where a template is turned off.** `gather_specs()`
drops those specs, so a disabled template is never registered — at startup or
after an edit — and stays disabled across a restart without anything having to
remember it. The key is absent from every spec written before #165 and absent
means enabled, so nothing goes dark on upgrade. Only the admin UI passes
`include_disabled=True`, because it has to list a disabled template in order
to offer Enable. Filtering here rather than at each registration site is
deliberate: a future consumer of `gather_specs()` cannot register a disabled
template by forgetting to check.

`is_enabled()` accepts more than a bare `false`, because PyYAML only coerces
the full words — `enabled: n` stays the string `"n"`, and so does `disable`,
which mirrors the admin UI's own button. Reading either as *enabled* would
invert the author's intent silently, so both count as off. A string in
neither vocabulary is treated as enabled — the safe direction, since a
template the AI cannot call looks like a broken server — but it is logged
with the template's name, so a typo is visible rather than guessed at.

`main.py` registers email templates first, then Word templates, whenever
either the master file or the `.d` directory exists.

## What a spec becomes

`_register_single_template()` in `docx_tools/dynamic_docx_tools.py` and
`_register_single_email_template()` in `email_tools/dynamic_email_tools.py`
follow the same steps:

1. **Validate the spec.** `name` is required. `docx_path` or `html_path`
   must be a bare filename; it is resolved through `template_utils`, custom
   directory first. A missing file skips the template with an error log.
2. **Build the argument model.** Each entry in `args` becomes a field on a
   Pydantic model created with `create_model()`. `TYPE_MAP` translates the
   YAML `type` string to a Python type; `enum` produces a `Literal`.
   `required` and `default` decide optionality. The email model starts from
   `BASE_FIELDS` (`subject` required, `to`, `cc`, `bcc` optional); the Word
   model starts empty.
3. **Expose the model in module globals.** FastMCP resolves the handler's
   annotation by name against the module namespace when it builds the
   schema, so the class must be importable from there.
4. **Register an `async def` handler** that splits build from upload, exactly
   as the static tools in `main.py` do:

   ```
   extract_user_context_from_request()          # event loop, request alive
   await run_blocking(_build, data)             # worker thread: render only
       -> (buffer, filename, add_unique_prefix)
   await upload_and_format_response(...)        # event loop: upload + format
   buffer.close()                               # in a finally
   ```

   `_build()` renders the template and returns the bytes; it never uploads and
   never closes the buffer, because the upload still has to read it. The
   handler returns `Union[str, dict]`: a URL string from a traditional
   backend, a LibreChat file artifact under `UPLOAD_STRATEGY=LIBRECHAT`.

   The order is the whole point. `upload_file()` is synchronous and refuses
   the LIBRECHAT strategy, so the upload has to be awaited; and
   `extract_user_context_from_request()` reads FastMCP's contextvar-based
   request, which `run_blocking()` does not carry onto a worker thread
   (`loop.run_in_executor()` without `contextvars.copy_context()`), so the
   headers have to be read before dispatch. Doing either the other way round
   is [#113](https://github.com/ForLegalAI/mcp-ms-office-documents/issues/113) again.
5. **Record the registration** in a lock-guarded module dict so the admin
   Status page can list live tools.

### Rendering, Word

The `_build()` body opens the template with python-docx, runs
`conditionals.resolve_conditionals()` with the argument payload, then
`_replace_placeholders_in_document()` with every value stringified, and hands
the saved buffer back to the handler to upload.

Placeholder replacement is the intricate part. Word splits text across runs
as it is edited, so `{{name}}` is often three runs. `_replace_placeholder_in_paragraph()`
joins the run texts, finds the placeholder, and captures the formatting of
the run it starts in. Then:

- a value with no block-level Markdown is rendered inline through
  `parse_inline_formatting()` into the paragraph, with the placeholder run's
  font, size, colour and emphasis re-applied to the new runs;
- a value with block-level Markdown (`contains_block_markdown()`) is rendered
  through `process_markdown_content(..., return_elements=True)` and the
  produced elements are inserted after the paragraph, with the placeholder
  paragraph's properties propagated.

Body, tables (including nested tables), headers and footers are all scanned.
Table cells, headers and footers get inline rendering only.

Conditionals are block markers on their own paragraphs (`{{#if flag}}`,
`{{^if flag}}`, `{{/if}}`) evaluated against argument truthiness. Unbalanced
markers keep all content and strip the markers; an unknown name keeps its
content. Body only.

### Rendering, email

The body renders the HTML with a default `pystache.Renderer` (so `{{x}}`
escapes and `{{{x}}}` is raw), wraps it in a base64 `MIMEText`, sets
`Subject`, recipients and `X-Unsent`, and uploads. The context is exactly the
declared arguments, with `None` flattened to `""` — nothing is synthesised.
An optional value is shown with a Mustache section over the argument itself
(`{{#arg}}…{{/arg}}`), in the template where it can be seen and styled.

## Live registration

`register_docx_template()` / `register_email_template()` remove any existing
tool of the same name through `template_registry.safe_remove_tool()`, which
prefers FastMCP's `local_provider.remove_tool` and tolerates version
differences, then register afresh. `unregister_*` removes and forgets. The
admin UI calls these after writing the `.d` file and the asset, so a saved
template is callable immediately.

`metrics.record_call()` and `record_error()` are called from the tool body,
keyed by kind and template name, for the Status page.

## What the admin UI reads a template with

Two modules under `admin/` serve the UI rather than the MCP tools, and are
the pieces of that package with no page of their own. Both are deliberately
import-light — no FastHTML — so they can be unit tested without standing the
UI up.

`admin/analysis.py` reads an uploaded asset and reports what the renderer
will act on, which is what lets the UI offer arguments instead of asking an
admin to type them:

| Function | Reports |
|---|---|
| `analyze_docx()` | `{{placeholders}}`, `{{#if}}` conditionals, the paragraph styles the file defines (for the style-mapping dropdowns) and which styles the renderer expects but the file lacks |
| `analyze_html()` | Mustache variables and sections |
| `analyze_pptx()` | Layouts, their placeholders, theme fonts and colours, plus warnings from `_add_pptx_warnings()` |
| `analyze()` | Dispatches on kind |
| `reconcile()` | Compares what was detected against the spec's declared `args`, so the UI can offer to add the missing ones and flag orphans |

It shares `PLACEHOLDER_PATTERN` with `dynamic_docx_tools`, so detection and
substitution cannot disagree about what a placeholder looks like.

`admin/preview.py` renders a managed template with sample values, in memory:
`render_docx_preview()`, `render_pptx_preview()` and `render_email_preview()`,
with `sample_values()` inventing plausible values from the declared args.
Two properties matter. It **never touches the upload backend** — the bytes
are returned, so a preview works on a server configured for S3 — and the Word
path goes through the *production* substitution pipeline
(`resolve_conditionals` + `replace_placeholders_in_document`), so the preview
cannot drift from what the live tool produces. The email path mirrors the
dynamic email tool's pystache rendering, building the context the same way:
declared arguments only, `None` flattened to `""`.

## The argument-schema rules

Three rules exist because of how MCP clients read schemas. They are tested
by `tests/test_dynamic_args_schema.py`.

- **Never `Optional[...]`.** An optional argument keeps its plain type and is
  simply absent from `required`. `anyOf: [type, null]` puts the description
  beside the `anyOf`, and several clients drop it.
- **A description is a sibling of a flat type.** Same reason.
- **`add_unique_prefix` has no default in the tool body.** The payload is
  built only from declared args, so `payload.get("add_unique_prefix")` yields
  `None` for a template that does not declare it, and the upload layer then
  applies the strategy default. A `False` default here would suppress the
  prefix on every backend.

`file_name` and `add_unique_prefix` are ordinary args: a template that wants
them must declare them. The email tool falls back to the subject, then the
template name, for the filename.

## Differences between the two kinds

| | Word | Email |
|-|------|-------|
| `TYPE_MAP` | string, int, float, bool, list | the same plus `dict`/`object` |
| Base fields | none | `subject`, `to`, `cc`, `bcc` |
| Global config | `style_mapping` from `global_config()`, merged with a per-template one | none |
| Escaping | Markdown rendering, no HTML | Mustache HTML escaping on `{{x}}` |
| Conditionals | `{{#if}}` block markers | Mustache sections `{{#x}}…{{/x}}` |
| Headers set | n/a | `Subject`, `To`/`Cc`/`Bcc`, `X-Unsent` only |

## Known limitations

- **Single instance.** Live registration assumes one process owns the
  template files. With replicas, use shared storage and restart.
- **Block content is body-only** in Word templates; see rendering above.
