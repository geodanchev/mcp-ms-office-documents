# branch below, not here. It pulls in httpx, and this module is imported by
# main.py on every startup — an eager import would make an optional backend's
# dependency mandatory for all strategies. The other backends follow the same
# rule (see the boto3 comment in upload_tools/backends/s3.py).

    LibreChat sends user information via HTTP headers:
    - X-User-Id: Required - LibreChat user ID
    - X-User-Email: Optional - User email
    - X-Conversation-Id: Optional - Current conversation ID

    Uses FastMCP's get_http_request() to access the current request.

    TRUST BOUNDARY NOTE:
    These headers are trusted verbatim without validation. This is intentional
    because LibreChat validates/authorizes the user before calling this MCP server.
    The MCP endpoint's API key auth (ApiKeyAuthMiddleware) ensures only LibreChat
    can reach this endpoint. LibreChat itself handles user authentication upstream,
    so by the time requests reach here, the user identity has already been verified.

    Returns:
        Dict with user_id, user_email, and conversation_id (may be None)
